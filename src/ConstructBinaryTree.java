public class ConstructBinaryTree {

    /*
    * We are building a new product that relies on a binary tree data structure, and we need to be able to construct
    * the tree given its preorder and inorder traversals. We have two integer arrays, one representing the preorder
    * traversal (root, left subtree, right subtree) and the other representing the inorder traversal (left subtree,
    * root, right subtree). Can you help us implement a function that takes in these two arrays and returns the binary
    * tree?
    *
    * Example 1:
    *
    * preorder = [3,9,20,15,7]
    * inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]
    *
    *           Output:
    *         3
    *        / \
    *       9  20
    *         /  \
    *        15   7
    *
