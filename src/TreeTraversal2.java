public class TreeTraversal2 {

    /*
    * As a data-driven startup, we aim to provide market analysis to our clients. We are currently building a binary
    * tree to store our client data. However, we have noticed that traversing the tree in a zigzag order would allow
    * us to better analyze the data. We need a function that takes the root of our binary tree and returns a zigzag
    * order traversal of its nodes' values. This means that the traversal should go from left to right for the first
    * level, then from right to left for the second level, and so on.
    *
    * Example 1:
    *  Input:
    *     3
    *    / \
    *   9  20
    *     /  \
    *    15   7
    *   Output: [3, 20, 9, 15, 7]
    *   Explanation:
    *   The zigzag level order traversal goes as follows:
    *   Level 1: 3
    *   Level 2: 20 -> 9
    *   Level 3: 15 -> 7
    *
    * Example 2:
    *       Input:
    *     1
    *    / \
    *   2   3
    *  / \   \
    * 4   5   6
    *
    * Output: [1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6]
    *   Explanation:
    *   The zigzag level order traversal goes as follows:
    *   Level 1: 1
    *   Level 2: 3 -> 2
    *   Level 3: 4 -> 5 -> 6
