    * As a data-driven startup, we aim to provide market analysis to our clients. We are currently building a binary
    * tree to store our client data. However, we have noticed that traversing the tree in a zigzag order would allow
    * us to better analyze the data. We need a function that takes the root of our binary tree and returns a zigzag
    * order traversal of its nodes' values. This means that the traversal should go from left to right for the first
    * level, then from right to left for the second level, and so on.
